    <h2>What is Forex</h2>
    <p>The foreign exchange market(Forex, Fx or currency market) is a global decentralized or over the counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. This market determines currency exchange rates for every currency. It includes all aspect of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or detremined prices. In terms of trading volumes, it is by far the largest market in the world.</p>
    <p>According to the Bank of International settlements, the preliminary global results from the 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Activity show that trading in foreign exchange markets averaged $6.6 trillion per day in April 2019. This is up from $5.1 trillion in April 2016. Below is the breakdown of the instruments traded and their respective volumes </p>
    <p>The $6.6 trillion break-down is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> $2 trillion in spot transactions</li>
      <li> $1 trillion in outright forwards</li>
      <li> $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange swaps</li>
      <li> $108 billion in currency swaps</li>
      <li> $294 billion in options and other products</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The foreign exchange market assists International trade and investments by enabling currency conversion. For example, it permits business in the United States to import goods from European Union member states, especially Eurozone members, and pay Euros, even though its income is in US Dollars. It also supports direct speculation, based on the differential interest rate between two currencies.</p>
    <p>In a typical foreign exchange transaction, a party purchases some quantity of one currency by paying with some quantity of another currency.</p>
